# Linear Regression with Scikit‑Learn

## Overview  
This project demonstrates an end‑to‑end linear regression workflow using Python’s scikit‑learn library. We leverage the California House Price dataset to predict median home values based on features like `median_income` and geographic metrics.

## Installation
